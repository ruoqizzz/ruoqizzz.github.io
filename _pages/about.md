I am a PhD Candidate supervised by [Per Mattsson](https://www.katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N10-1806) and co-supervised by [Torbjörn Wigren](https://www.katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N0-536) at Uppsala University. My research focuses on Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Automatic Control, particularly addressing how control could assist RL and uncertainty in RL.



I earned my master from Uppsala Univerity in 2020 and did my thesis in [Uppsala System and Control Division](https://www.it.uu.se/about_us/divisions/systems_and_control). Beyond my research, I organize SysCon RL Reading Group, engaging weekly in recent RL papers to foster understanding and innovation within the field.
